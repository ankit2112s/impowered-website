## imPowered
- imPowered is a Web Based Application Built to assist physically challenged people in their day to day lives which we don't see that they suffer from.Our aim at imPowered is to empower and enhance the lives of disabled individuals by providing them with essential information about facilities at public places. We are dedicated to breaking down the barriers that often limit their participation in everyday activities.
- Our mission is rooted in inclusivity, and we strive to ensure that no disabled person ever feels excluded or left uninformed when they venture into public spaces. By offering accurate, up-to-date information about accessibility features, restroom locations, and other pertinent details, we aim to foster independence, reduce stress, and promote greater inclusivity and participation for all.
- Ultimately, we believe that equal access to information leads to greater equal access to the world, and we are committed to making this vision a reality for disabled individuals everywhere.
